# Mission-to-Mars

# Overview of Project

We are in charged of a webscraping project and needed to scrape all things related to Mars, and we have helped Robin to build this project to  build a portfolio of news, information and pictures about Mars to help her get a coveted position with NASA. We have scraped already latest news, Mars images, and Mar's facts. We are going to take it a step further to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 


# Overall Outcome

This project allowed us to use a few different tools together to help us get data/information/pictures using Python and some new libraries to scrape from various websites. We then had to store all the great information we collected in MongoDB (considered an unstructured database) which allows us to store different data/info in various structures as collections within that database. With our knowledge of Flask, we were able run the scraping functions we built, save them to the database and then retrieve them for a webpage we created that was structured using an HTML index... which included a button on the webpage where we can refresh the data with a simple click!


# Closing Statement

While building the webpage and getting all the information flowing to the page was a lot of work, some challenges were making sure the index.html template was nice and clean with its indentations to make it easier for future modifications. With modifications needed to adjust the mobile-responsive with Bootstrap 3 - we made it the fonts smaller to accomendate the size difference in the regular desktop browser.
